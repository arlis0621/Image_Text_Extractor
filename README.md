# Image_Text_Extractor
In this project, we will be working on extracting text from Images.

After extracting the text we will apply some basic functions of OpenCV on that text to enhance it and get more accurate results.

Steps Involved:

1.Download Tesseract and install it with other dependencies.
2.Preprocess the Images and visualise them.
3.Using Pytesseract to extract text from image.
4.Using CV for further processing of complex images.
5.Removing Noise from the Image using the Blur Function.
6.Perform Threshold Transformation of the image.
7.Draw rectangles around a character and a paticular pattern/word.

Benefits:  Different organizations can use this to extract useful information from the image and store it.It will ease the burden of document analysis and understanding them.It will reduce man work by automating the OCR method for text extraction
